PrimeFibonacciChecker is a fairly simple program from my CS260 class, conceptually, that involves determining which numbers are prime, which are fibonacci numbers, and then check to see which are both. Additionally, our professor wanted us to do all three simultaneously using multithreading; though I knew the conceptual information given in class, actually implementing it gave me a completely different level of understanding. It was also interesting afterwards to see all of the different ways my friends used to make their program work.
